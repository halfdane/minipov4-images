# Images for MiniPOV-4

@see [MiniPOV-4](https://learn.adafruit.com/minipov4-diy-full-color-persistence-of-vision-light-painting-kit/overview)
Some images with height of 8 px. I extracted some parts from the adafruit's example images, some were made by me.

If you use linux and have trouble getting images to the device, 
check my fork of [Adafruit-MiniPOV4-Kit](https://github.com/halfdane/Adafruit-MiniPOV4-Kit) - it should get you running.
At least until my pull request is merged into mainline.
